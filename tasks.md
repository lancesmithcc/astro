## Current Status
✅ **COMPLETED** - Tarot card API integration with images successfully implemented!

### What's Been Accomplished:
1. **API Service Created** (`src/services/tarotAPI.ts`):
   - Full integration with tarot card API (https://tarotapi.netlify.app/api/v1)
   - Methods for fetching random cards, all cards, and converting data
   - Image URL generation for card visuals

2. **Type Definitions Updated** (`src/types/index.ts`):
   - Enhanced TarotCard interface with image and description properties
   - Full compatibility with API response structure

3. **Card Display Components**:
   - New TarotCardComponent with flip animations and image support
   - Updated CardPile component to use new API service
   - 3D CSS transforms for realistic card flip effects

4. **Image Integration**:
   - Proper image loading with error handling
   - Fallback displays when images fail to load
   - Loading states and smooth transitions

5. **Testing Component** (`src/components/TarotAPITest.tsx`):
   - Demonstrates API integration working
   - Shows cards with images, meanings, and descriptions
   - Error handling and loading states

### Ready for Use:
The tarot card system now displays actual card images fetched from the API, with proper fallbacks and animations. The integration is complete and functional!

## Phase 5: Enhanced User Experience
- ✅ Add card expansion/modal functionality
  - Double-click cards in pile to expand (blow up) to full details
  - Single-click selected cards to expand them
  - Modal displays large card image, meanings, keywords, and descriptions
  - Smooth animations and mystical styling
  - Proper backdrop and close functionality

## Phase 6: Visual Enhancement
- ✅ Implement animated space SVG background
  - Full viewport coverage on all devices
  - Responsive design for mobile and desktop
  - Fixed background attachment for immersive experience
  - Proper fallbacks and mobile optimization
  - Beautiful animated starfield with twinkling stars

## Phase 7: Language & Clarity Improvements

- [x] Replace numeric card energy references (e.g., "1 energy") with human-friendly descriptors
  - Added `extractKeywords` helper in `src/services/tarotAPI.ts` to pull descriptive keywords from each card's upright meaning.
  - Filters out purely numeric or Roman-numeral strings so guidance now says things like "Creativity energy" instead of "1 energy".
- [x] Ensure guidance wording remains accessible and avoids overly technical astrology jargon.
  - Existing wording is already conversational; numeric fix removes the most confusing phrasing.

### Status

✅ **COMPLETED** – Card energy language now uses recognizable descriptive terms.

### Reliability of Tarot Card Images
- [x] Switch to a reliable, cached image proxy (`images.weserv.nl`) for all card images to prevent broken loads.
- [ ] Monitor app in production for any residual missing‐image reports and introduce further fallbacks if needed.
